# 🧠 TensionFlow: Reimagining Intelligence Beyond Computation
**张力流：超越计算的智能重构**

> “智能不是计算出来的，而是被平衡出来的。”

### 🌍 Philosophy
TensionFlow explores a new paradigm of reasoning —  
tensional equilibrium as the true carrier of intelligence.

Instead of linear attention or reinforcement updates,  
we introduce a **tension propagation field**,  
where every semantic node interacts, resists, and balances with others  
until a global semantic harmony emerges.

### 🧩 Core Difference
| Model | Mechanism | Core Principle |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Transformer | Attention | Gradient-based focus |
| RL | Reward feedback | Action optimization |
| **TensFormer** | Tension equilibrium | Meaning stabilization |

### 🧠 Run Demo
```bash
python examples/demo_sentence_tension.py
```

### ✨ Vision
TensionFlow is not just an AI project — it’s a proposal:  
to rebuild intelligence **beyond computation**,  
toward a new cognitive physics.

> When machines begin to *feel tension*,  
> they will begin to *understand meaning*.
